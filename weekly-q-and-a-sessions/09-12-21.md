## Notes

### Discussion point: Vegard

Discussion of the breadcrumbs component with regards to https://github.com/fabric-ds/react/pull/66#issuecomment-989643169
Main issue is that its easy to wrap links in a fragment and assume that this doesnt count (will be stripped out) which is incorrect

### Discussion point: Vegard

Discussion of various features needed and issues encountered when implementing Fabric React components on search results page
List from Vegard:
Combobox features:
- just display options, don’t match
- don’t catch Enter
- inputClassName override mb-0
- listClassName override pb-0
- disable list above
- affix icon
- both prefix and suffix
- less divs (nested .input classes)
- affix less divs
- affix type boolean
- affix onClick event

### Discussion point

This lead into a discussion of process
* how do we evaluate feature requests and whether they should be included in Fabric?
    * multiple concerns such as
        * do multiple teams need?
        * should we use this as an opportunity to reevealute from a design/ux perspective?
* how do we support teams immediate needs while we evaluate whether features should go into Fabric?
    * One suggestion is to implement features initially as "technical previews" which would be subject to change during an evaluation period while at the same time writing up feature requests for discussion. Adi mentioned taking things back to UX channel and asking if others have the same feature needs etc. ACTION: Richie to write up a proposal for this

### Discussion point: Jakub

Jakub mentioned that on his team they have components that they wonder if could be split out for shared usage. Some discussion followed about evaluation of things that should go into Fabric based on whether they are building blocks and whether at least a couple other teams might have need of them.

### Discussion point: Vegar 

Vegard questioned what to do about error states in checkboxes
ACTION: Adi to look into checkbox validation
