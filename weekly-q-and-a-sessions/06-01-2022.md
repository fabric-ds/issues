## Notes

### New team member!

Ingrid joined us for the first time and will be able to use 10% of her time on Fabric!

### Thomas: question about shadow dom podlets

Thomas has a podlet that is embedded in Troika layouts and is seeing styles leaking in from the page to the podlet.

Things like the following are affected:
* Font weight
* Borders
* Padding

Thomas supplied some screenshots of the issues:

**ACTION:** (Richard) Give Thomas a hand to figure out whats going on.

### Adi gave an update regarding checkbox error states

Showed demo in Figma with discussion.
Icon implementation needs some thought. First icon to have an internal cut out.
Snorre mentioned it should be easy enough to do the icon CSS only

### Benjamin asked about a color blindness setting

Question about whether it would be beneficial to add a setting for users to specify what sort of color blindness/sight issues they have
Adi mentioned that as a general UX principal its good to try to solve it for everyone.

### Vegard, feedback/discussion on combobox

Combobox on the search pages is slightly different from the standard combobox in Fabric

Changes made to Combobox component used on search result pages:
* Removed filtering valid options based on user input. Options list is controlled entirely by API, and rendering becomes more stable. (Feature)
* Removed list placement above textfield input. I find the behavior a bit strange, adding possibly unnecessary complexity. (Discussion)
* Removed aria status message. It doesn’t seem to be required, and I wonder if it is needed for our specific use case. (Feature)
* Match highlighting is modified to align better with search algorithm (Feature)
* Added input value match as state to each option, making the options list rendering more stable. (Feature)
* Added internal navigation value state, allowing the onChange handler to not set value prop on Combobox component. (Discussion)
* Made small changes to how the component behaves for keyboard navigation and change/select/blur handlers. (Connected to the point above)
* Added onBlur handler to permit un-committing selection of options (specifically when the user navigates to an option using keyboard, and then tabs, or clicks outside the component instead of hitting Enter). (Feature)
* Increased the options list z-index to deal with some stacking context issues in Safari mobile. (Bug fix)

The list appears to be a set of bugs, features and some items that may clash with the existing combobox.
I've labelled them 

**ACTION:** (Benjamin) Go through the items and create discussions and tasks as needed
