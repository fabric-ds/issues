## Notes

### Bug Reports: Martine Trulsrud

Martine reported a couple bugs in the React components after working with Martin the day before

#### Text field component
* If you use affix and have too many characters in the main field, the affix gets pushed down
* prefix is read last by screen reader

#### Combobox component
* tabbing away from a combobox does not select the value, you have to click on it
* No onBlur/onfocus events

#### Expandable component
* content not hidden from screen readers when not expanded

### Discussion: Adi Dick

Revisited a point made by Vegard last week regarding checkboxes and validation messages. Adi showed some ideas in Figma and mentioned furthering discussion regarding needs with Vegard.
